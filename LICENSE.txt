11.1.   You, at your own expense, shall indemnify Company against all losses, damages, claims, expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) arising out of or resulting from (a) any use of the Software by you (unless and only to the extent the loss is attributable to a breach by Company of any obligation under this Agreement), (b) any breach by you of this Agreement, or (c) any actions by you or any third party that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if that third-party were a party to this Agreement and its obligations were substantially the same as your obligations.
